# CS-255

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

    The client, DriverPass, sought to fill a hole in the availability of educational content for unlicensed student drivers. They wished to create a system that would host study materials, particularly online practice tests that were accurate to current DMV testing standards (achieved via a connection to a DMV database). They also wanted their system to allow users to book in-person driving lessons with the company's employed driving instructors.

What did you do particularly well?

    I feel I did a fine job communicating that which I interpreted to be the company's needs for the system and translating them into functional and nonfunctional requirements in the business requirements document.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    I would have liked to spend more time on the UML diagrams included in the system design document. I feel I could have made better use of proper UML notation. I would have also liked to have followed the industry best practice of including a link to the editable file for each UML diagram such that myself or other hypothetical design team members could update them as needed.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    The company's vision was communicated through interview and documentation. Through careful review and analysis of these materials, this vision was converted into design requirements. Without due consideration to all client input, the design of the final system may fall short of the client's desired functionality, which is a dealbreaking issue for a systems analyst.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    I will certainly appreciate the utility of interview in future. I also intend to utilize prototyping, or the creation of system mock-ups that can help me confirm with the client and users that I have understood their desires for the system. I believe it is incredibly important to have regular communication with the client during the systems development life cycle.
